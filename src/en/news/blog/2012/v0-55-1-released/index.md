There were some packaging and init script issues with v0.55, so a small point release is out. It fixes a few odds and ends:

- init-ceph: typo (new ‘fs type’ stuff was broken)
- debian: fixed conflicting upstart and sysvinit scripts
- auth: fixed default auth settings
- osd: dropped some broken asserts
- librbd: fix locking bug, race with ‘flatten’

You can get this release from the usual locations:
