We're excited to announce that Ceph and [Rook](https://rook.io) will participate in this next Outreachy December 2020 round!

> “**Outreachy** internships were inspired in many ways by Google Summer of Code and by how few women and minorities applied for it in the past. By having a program targeted specifically towards people traditionally underrepresented in tech, we found that we reached talented and passionate participants, who were uncertain about how to start otherwise. We hope this effort will help many people learn how exciting, varied and valuable work on FOSS projects can be and how inclusive the community really is. This program is a welcoming link that will connect you with people working on individual projects in various FOSS organizations and guide you through your first contribution.”

Ceph's August 2019 intern, Deepika Upadhyay contributed to improving tracing services for distributed systems like Ceph and gave a [final presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7mZJIC4FU) at DevConf Czech.

This time we're searching for two Ceph interns and one Rook intern to help continue improvements internally within Ceph and throughout the Kubernetes ecosystem.

A special thanks to [Red Hat](https://redhat.com) for providing funding for all three interns this round!

**Interns**: Deepika has written a helpful [guide](https://medium.com/@deepikaupadhyay/how-to-apply-for-outreachy-being-a-complete-beginner-648a3bcaf57b) to get you started for applying.

**Mentors**: Projects can be collaborated to start on [etherpad](https://pad.ceph.com/p/project-ideas). Once a project has a mentor and been defined it can be submitted to Outeachy on the following links:

- [Ceph](https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/ceph)
- [Rook](https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/rook)

We look forward to you join us!

> **Ceph** is distributed, software-defined storage that allows users to turn commodity hardware into a massively scalable storage cluster with no single point of failure. This storage solution is able to speak object, block, and file which unifies all storage needs under a single system with self-managing and self-healing characteristics. Ceph is already integrated with many systems, including the ever-growing world of cloud offerings like OpenStack, CloudStack, OpenNebula, Ganeti, and others. While Ceph is written in C/C++, the majority of projects for Ceph this round are Python-based.

> **[Rook](https://rook.io)** turns distributed storage systems into self-managing, self-scaling, self-healing storage services. It automates the tasks of a storage administrator: deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management.
> 
> Rook uses the power of the Kubernetes platform to deliver its services via a Kubernetes Operator for each storage provider.
