City Network, a leading global supplier of cloud services based on OpenStack, today announced a new and updated version of its cloud management system for its City Cloud infrastructure service.

The digital transformation requires extreme focus on automation. As a response to this the updated cloud management system has been developed with a focus on streamlining and simplifying all aspects of managing a cloud-based infrastructure. This includes everything from access and role management to administration of virtual resources such as containers, Kubernetes, virtual machines, networks and storage. Furthermore, built in tools for administration increase control and free up time for development.

“Today we are taking an important step in helping our customers further improve the efficiency of their cloud infrastructure. By allowing users to setup Kubernetes and containers in just minutes, critical new technology is not only made available but also easy to use. In the same browser window our customers get complete control over global resources as well as cost control”, says Johan Christenson, CEO and founder of City Network.

The cloud management system is built with the latest technology which allows for responsiveness and ease of use. By unifying access to all functionality available in City Cloud it is now easier than ever to manage resources across City Cloud locations for data residency purposes, whether running containers or just storing data in object storage.

The company’s heavy focus on regulatory compliance is reflected in the cloud management system. The built-in role-management function makes it easy to keep track of  authorization  and an activity log monitors and records access. This creates an opportunity for companies in regulated industries to take full advantage of the features provided by the system.

Creating an overview and controlling costs, budget, PO numbers and invoices is often time-consuming. With its built-in functionality for easy administration, the cloud management system provides users with a quick overview of all of the administrative aspects of a project, freeing up time for development projects.

“In a tightly regulated business environment, it is crucial that organizations have full control over who has access to what information and to which systems. Our new cloud management system lays the groundwork for this and helps organizations to manage and fully leverage a virtual IT infrastructure at a global level”, says Johan Christenson.
