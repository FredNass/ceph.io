With the Ceph Octopus release out the door, we are kicking off development of Pacific, the next major release of Ceph. This release is named after the [Pacific octopus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Pacific_octopus) and is due out in March of 2021.

We had originally planned several in-person meetings at Cephalocon in Seoul, but since that was canceled and much of the world is on some sort of lock-down anyway, we're doing things online--next week!

As always, these meetings appear on the Ceph community calendar, which you can [view directly in a browser](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=9ts9c7lt7u1vic2ijvvqqlfpo0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FChicago) or add to your Google calendar with the code `9ts9c7lt7u1vic2ijvvqqlfpo0@group.calendar.google.com` (highly recommended to avoid any ambiguity around time zones and schedule changes).

These are video calls and are open to anyone who is interested.
