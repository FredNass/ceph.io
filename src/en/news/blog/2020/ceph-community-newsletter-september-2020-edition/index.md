Due to individual countries' COVID-19 custom restrictions, we are unable to ship shirts to the following countries:

We are currently looking into a local vendor in India.

We are also in the process of setting a Ceph store for people to purchase this shirt or previous Ceph release shirts.

### Ceph User Survey 2020 Planning

Anantha Adiga has just [announced](https://lists.ceph.io/hyperkitty/list/ceph-users@ceph.io/thread/6A4TGUV6UGLY42BNFTGR2JWZQD7FZMHZ/) the start of the Ceph User Survey 2020 planning. Two goals: create a special interest group to annually plan for the next user survey, and improve the questions of the user survey to get the best data with the participation time. You can review the [2019](https://ceph.io/community/ceph-user-survey-2019/) and [2018](https://ceph.io/ceph-blog/ceph-user-survey-2018-results/) survey results for reference.
