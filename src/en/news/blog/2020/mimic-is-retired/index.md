This post is to announce the retirement of v13.2.X Mimic stable release series, and there will no longer be any more backport releases to Mimic. Any more patches to the Mimic branch will have to be tested by the developer submitting the patches and approved by the tech lead of the respective component to keep the branch stable.  
  
The last release of Mimic was v13.2.10 released on Apr 2020. This is keeping up with the active 2 stable releases and 24 month support cycle, which is documented at the [official release docs](https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/releases/general/#lifetime-of-stable-releases)  
  
Users are requested to upgrade to Nautilus or Octopus.
