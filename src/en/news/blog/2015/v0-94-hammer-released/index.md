title: "v0.94 Hammer released"
date: "2015-04-07"
author: "sage"

This major release is expected to form the basis of the next long-term stable series. It is intended to supersede v0.80.x Firefly.

Highlights since Giant include:

- _RADOS Performance_: a range of improvements have been made in the OSD and client-side librados code that improve the throughput on flash backends and improve parallelism and scaling on fast machines.
- _Simplified RGW deployment_: the ceph-deploy tool now has a new ‘ceph-deploy rgw create HOST’ command that quickly deploys a instance of the S3/Swift gateway using the embedded Civetweb server. This is vastly simpler than the previous Apache-based deployment. There are a few rough edges (e.g., around SSL support) but we encourage users to try [the new method](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/start/quick-ceph-deploy/#add-an-rgw-instance).
- _RGW object versioning_: RGW now supports the S3 object versioning API, which preserves old version of objects instead of overwriting them.
- _RGW bucket sharding_: RGW can now shard the bucket index for large buckets across, improving performance for very large buckets.
- _RBD object maps_: RBD now has an object map function that tracks which parts of the image are allocating, improving performance for clones and for commands like export and delete.
- _RBD mandatory locking_: RBD has a new mandatory locking framework (still disabled by default) that adds additional safeguards to prevent multiple clients from using the same image at the same time.
- _RBD copy-on-read_: RBD now supports copy-on-read for image clones, improving performance for some workloads.
- _CephFS snapshot improvements_: Many many bugs have been fixed with CephFS snapshots. Although they are still disabled by default, stability has improved significantly.
- _CephFS Recovery tools_: We have built some journal recovery and diagnostic tools. Stability and performance of single-MDS systems is vastly improved in Giant, and more improvements have been made now in Hammer. Although we still recommend caution when storing important data in CephFS, we do encourage testing for non-critical workloads so that we can better guage the feature, usability, performance, and stability gaps.
- _CRUSH improvements_: We have added a new straw2 bucket algorithm that reduces the amount of data migration required when changes are made to the cluster.
- _Shingled erasure codes (SHEC)_: The OSDs now have experimental support for shingled erasure codes, which allow a small amount of additional storage to be traded for improved recovery performance.
- _RADOS cache tiering_: A series of changes have been made in the cache tiering code that improve performance and reduce latency.
- _Experimental RDMA support_: There is now experimental support for RDMA via the Accelio (libxio) library.
- _New administrator commands_: The ‘ceph osd df’ command shows pertinent details on OSD disk utilizations. The ‘ceph pg ls ...’ command makes it much simpler to query PG states while diagnosing cluster issues.

Other highlights since Firefly include:

- _CephFS_: we have fixed a raft of bugs in CephFS and built some basic journal recovery and diagnostic tools. Stability and performance of single-MDS systems is vastly improved in Giant. Although we do not yet recommend CephFS for production deployments, we do encourage testing for non-critical workloads so that we can better guage the feature, usability, performance, and stability gaps.
- _Local Recovery Codes_: the OSDs now support an erasure-coding scheme that stores some additional data blocks to reduce the IO required to recover from single OSD failures.
- _Degraded vs misplaced_: the Ceph health reports from ‘ceph -s’ and related commands now make a distinction between data that is degraded (there are fewer than the desired number of copies) and data that is misplaced (stored in the wrong location in the cluster). The distinction is important because the latter does not compromise data safety.
- _Tiering improvements_: we have made several improvements to the cache tiering implementation that improve performance. Most notably, objects are not promoted into the cache tier by a single read; they must be found to be sufficiently hot before that happens.
- _Monitor performance_: the monitors now perform writes to the local data store asynchronously, improving overall responsiveness.
- _Recovery tools_: the ceph-objectstore-tool is greatly expanded to allow manipulation of an individual OSDs data store for debugging and repair purposes. This is most heavily used by our QA infrastructure to exercise recovery code.

I would like to take this opportunity to call out the amazing growth in contributors to Ceph beyond the core development team from Inktank. Hammer features major new features and improvements from Intel, Fujitsu, UnitedStack, Yahoo, UbuntuKylin, CohortFS, Mellanox, CERN, Deutsche Telekom, Mirantis, and SanDisk.

### DEDICATION

This release is dedicated in memoriam to Sandon Van Ness, aka Houkouonchi, who unexpectedly passed away a few weeks ago. Sandon was responsible for maintaining the large and complex Sepia lab that houses the Ceph project’s build and test infrastructure. His efforts have made an important impact on our ability to reliably test Ceph with a relatively small group of people. He was a valued member of the team and we will miss him. H is also for Houkouonchi.

### UPGRADING

- If your existing cluster is running a version older than v0.80.x Firefly, please first upgrade to the latest Firefly release before moving on to Giant. We have not tested upgrades directly from Emperor, Dumpling, or older releases.We _have_ tested:
    
    > - Firefly to Hammer
    > - Firefly to Giant to Hammer
    > - Dumpling to Firefly to Hammer
    
- Please upgrade daemons in the following order:
    
    > 1. Monitors
    > 2. OSDs
    > 3. MDSs and/or radosgw
    
    Note that the relative ordering of OSDs and monitors should not matter, but we primarily tested upgrading monitors first.
- The ceph-osd daemons will perform a disk-format upgrade improve the PG metadata layout and to repair a minor bug in the on-disk format. It may take a minute or two for this to complete, depending on how many objects are stored on the node; do not be alarmed if they do not marked “up” by the cluster immediately after starting.
- If upgrading from v0.93, set
    
    osd enable degraded writes = false
    
    on all osds prior to upgrading. The degraded writes feature has been reverted due to 11155.
- The LTTNG tracing in librbd and librados is disabled in the release packages until we find a way to avoid violating distro security policies when linking libust.

### UPGRADING FROM V0.80.X GIANT

- librbd and librados include lttng tracepoints on distros with liblttng 2.4 or later (only Ubuntu Trusty for the ceph.com packages). When running a daemon that uses these libraries, i.e. an application that calls fork(2) or clone(2) without exec(3), you must set LD\_PRELOAD=liblttng-ust-fork.so.0 to prevent a crash in the lttng atexit handler when the process exits. The only ceph tool that requires this is rbd-fuse.
- If rgw\_socket\_path is defined and rgw\_frontends defines a socket\_port and socket\_host, we now allow the rgw\_frontends settings to take precedence. This change should only affect users who have made non-standard changes to their radosgw configuration.
- If you are upgrading specifically from v0.92, you must stop all OSD daemons and flush their journals (ceph-osd -i NNN --flush-journal) before upgrading. There was a transaction encoding bug in v0.92 that broke compatibility. Upgrading from v0.93, v0.91, or anything earlier is safe.
- The experimental ‘keyvaluestore-dev’ OSD backend has been renamed ‘keyvaluestore’ (for simplicity) and marked as experimental. To enable this untested feature and acknowledge that you understand that it is untested and may destroy data, you need to add the following to your ceph.conf:
    
    enable experimental unrecoverable data corrupting featuers = keyvaluestore
    
- The following librados C API function calls take a ‘flags’ argument whose value is now correctly interpreted:
    
    > rados\_write\_op\_operate() rados\_aio\_write\_op\_operate() rados\_read\_op\_operate() rados\_aio\_read\_op\_operate()
    
    The flags were not correctly being translated from the librados constants to the internal values. Now they are. Any code that is passing flags to these methods should be audited to ensure that they are using the correct LIBRADOS\_OP\_FLAG\_\* constants.
- The ‘rados’ CLI ‘copy’ and ‘cppool’ commands now use the copy-from operation, which means the latest CLI cannot run these commands against pre-firefly OSDs.
- The librados watch/notify API now includes a watch\_flush() operation to flush the async queue of notify operations. This should be called by any watch/notify user prior to rados\_shutdown().
- The ‘category’ field for objects has been removed. This was originally added to track PG stat summations over different categories of objects for use by radosgw. It is no longer has any known users and is prone to abuse because it can lead to a pg\_stat\_t structure that is unbounded. The librados API calls that accept this field now ignore it, and the OSD no longers tracks the per-category summations.
- The output for ‘rados df’ has changed. The ‘category’ level has been eliminated, so there is now a single stat object per pool. The structure of the JSON output is different, and the plaintext output has one less column.
- The ‘rados create <objectname> \[category\]’ optional category argument is no longer supported or recognized.
- rados.py’s Rados class no longer has a \_\_del\_\_ method; it was causing problems on interpreter shutdown and use of threads. If your code has Rados objects with limited lifetimes and you’re concerned about locked resources, call Rados.shutdown() explicitly.
- There is a new version of the librados watch/notify API with vastly improved semantics. Any applications using this interface are encouraged to migrate to the new API. The old API calls are marked as deprecated and will eventually be removed.
- The librados rados\_unwatch() call used to be safe to call on an invalid handle. The new version has undefined behavior when passed a bogus value (for example, when rados\_watch() returns an error and handle is not defined).
- The structure of the formatted ‘pg stat’ command is changed for the portion that counts states by name to avoid using the ‘+’ character (which appears in state names) as part of the XML token (it is not legal).
- Previously, the formatted output of ‘ceph pg stat -f ...’ was a full pg dump that included all metadata about all PGs in the system. It is now a concise summary of high-level PG stats, just like the unformatted ‘ceph pg stat’ command.
- All JSON dumps of floating point values were incorrecting surrounding the value with quotes. These quotes have been removed. Any consumer of structured JSON output that was consuming the floating point values was previously having to interpret the quoted string and will most likely need to be fixed to take the unquoted number.
- New ability to list all objects from all namespaces can fail or return incomplete results when not all OSDs have been upgraded. Features rados –all ls, rados cppool, rados export, rados cache-flush-evict-all and rados cache-try-flush-evict-all can also fail or return incomplete results.
- Due to a change in the Linux kernel version 3.18 and the limits of the FUSE interface, ceph-fuse needs be mounted as root on at least some systems. See issues #9997, #10277, and #10542 for details.

### UPGRADING FROM V0.80X FIREFLY (ADDITIONAL NOTES)

- The client-side caching for librbd is now enabled by default (rbd cache = true). A safety option (rbd cache writethrough until flush = true) is also enabled so that writeback caching is not used until the library observes a ‘flush’ command, indicating that the librbd users is passing that operation through from the guest VM. This avoids potential data loss when used with older versions of qemu that do not support flush.
    
    > leveldb\_write\_buffer\_size = 8\*1024\*1024 = 33554432 // 8MB leveldb\_cache\_size = 512\*1024\*1204 = 536870912 // 512MB leveldb\_block\_size = 64\*1024 = 65536 // 64KB leveldb\_compression = false leveldb\_log = “”
    
    OSDs will still maintain the following osd-specific defaults:
    
    > leveldb\_log = “”
    
- The ‘rados getxattr ...’ command used to add a gratuitous newline to the attr value; it now does not.
- The \*\_kb perf counters on the monitor have been removed. These are replaced with a new set of \*\_bytes counters (e.g., cluster\_osd\_kb is replaced by cluster\_osd\_bytes).
- The rd\_kb and wr\_kb fields in the JSON dumps for pool stats (accessed via the ceph df detail -f json-pretty and related commands) have been replaced with corresponding \*\_bytes fields. Similarly, thetotal\_space, total\_used, and total\_avail fields are replaced with total\_bytes, total\_used\_bytes, and total\_avail\_bytes fields.
- The rados df --format=json output read\_bytes and write\_bytes fields were incorrectly reporting ops; this is now fixed.
- The rados df --format=json output previously included read\_kb and write\_kb fields; these have been removed. Please use read\_bytes and write\_bytes instead (and divide by 1024 if appropriate).
- The experimental keyvaluestore-dev OSD backend had an on-disk format change that prevents existing OSD data from being upgraded. This affects developers and testers only.
- mon-specific and osd-specific leveldb options have been removed. From this point onward users should use the leveldb\_\* generic options and add the options in the appropriate sections of their configuration files. Monitors will still maintain the following monitor-specific defaults:
    
    > leveldb\_write\_buffer\_size = 8\*1024\*1024 = 33554432 // 8MB leveldb\_cache\_size = 512\*1024\*1204 = 536870912 // 512MB leveldb\_block\_size = 64\*1024 = 65536 // 64KB leveldb\_compression = false leveldb\_log = “”
    
    OSDs will still maintain the following osd-specific defaults:
    
    > leveldb\_log = “”
    
- CephFS support for the legacy anchor table has finally been removed. Users with file systems created before firefly should ensure that inodes with multiple hard links are modified _prior_ to the upgrade to ensure that the backtraces are written properly. For example:
    
    sudo find /mnt/cephfs -type f -links +1 -exec touch \\{\\} \\;
    
- We disallow nonsensical ‘tier cache-mode’ transitions. From this point onward, ‘writeback’ can only transition to ‘forward’ and ‘forward’ can transition to 1) ‘writeback’ if there are dirty objects, or 2) any if there are no dirty objects.
