We are quickly approaching the Hammer feature freeze but have a few more dev releases to go before we get there. The headline items are subtree-based quota support in CephFS (ceph-fuse/libcephfs client support only for now), a rewrite of the watch/notify librados API used by RBD and RGW, OSDMap checksums to ensure that maps are always consistent inside the cluster, new API calls in librados and librbd for IO hinting modeled after posix\_fadvise, and improved storage of per-PG state.

We expect two more releases before the first Hammer release candidate (v0.93).

### UPGRADING

- The ‘category’ field for objects has been removed. This was originally added to track PG stat summations over different categories of objects for use by radosgw. It is no longer has any known users and is prone to abuse because it can lead to a pg\_stat\_t structure that is unbounded. The librados API calls that accept this field now ignore it, and the OSD no longers tracks the per-category summations.
- The output for ‘rados df’ has changed. The ‘category’ level has been eliminated, so there is now a single stat object per pool. The structure of the JSON output is different, and the plaintext output has one less column.
- The ‘rados create <objectname> \[category\]’ optional category argument is no longer supported or recognized.
- rados.py’s Rados class no longer has a \_\_del\_\_ method; it was causing problems on interpreter shutdown and use of threads. If your code has Rados objects with limited lifetimes and you’re concerned about locked resources, call Rados.shutdown() explicitly.
- There is a new version of the librados watch/notify API with vastly improved semantics. Any applications using this interface are encouraged to migrate to the new API. The old API calls are marked as deprecated and will eventually be removed.
- The librados rados\_unwatch() call used to be safe to call on an invalid handle. The new version has undefined behavior when passed a bogus value (for example, when rados\_watch() returns an error and handle is not defined).
- The structure of the formatted ‘pg stat’ command is changed for the portion that counts states by name to avoid using the ‘+’ character (which appears in state names) as part of the XML token (it is not legal).
