This is a long-awaited bugfix release for firefly. It several imporant (but relatively rare) OSD peering fixes, performance issues when snapshots are trimmed, several RGW fixes, a paxos corner case fix, and some packaging updates.

We recommend that all users for v0.80.x firefly upgrade when it is convenient to do so.
