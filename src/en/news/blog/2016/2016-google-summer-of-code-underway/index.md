The Ceph project would like to congratulate the following students on their acceptance to the 2016 Google Summer of Code program, and the Ceph project:

<table><tbody><tr><td><b>Student</b></td><td><b>Project</b></td></tr><tr><td>Shehbaz Jaffer</td><td>BlueStore</td></tr><tr><td>Victor Araujo</td><td>End-to-end Performance Visualization</td></tr><tr><td>Aburudha Bose</td><td>Improve Overall Python Infrastructure</td></tr><tr><td>Zhao Junwang</td><td>Over-the-wire Encryption Support</td></tr><tr><td>Oleh Prypin</td><td>Python 3 Support for Ceph</td></tr></tbody></table>

These five students represent the best of the almost 70 project submissions that we fielded from students around the world. For those not familiar with the Google Summer of Code program, this means that Google will generously fund these students during their summer work.

Thanks to everyone who applied this year, the selection process was made very challenging by the number of highly qualified applicants. We look forward to mentoring students to a successful summer of coding and Open Source, both this year and in the years to come.
