During the two conference days over 1000 people including developers, users, companies, community members and other Ceph enthusiasts attended to the 52 keynotes and talks about Enterprise applications, Development, Operation and Maintenance practices.

### Pre-Conference

Since several contributors from all over the world traveled to China to participate Cephalocon we took the opportunity to [organize meetings](https://pad.ceph.com/p/beijing-meetings) to discuss the projects like RADOS, RBD, RGW, Dashboard as well important topics such as Containers, Usability, Performance and QA.

### First Day

More than 600 people were present at the Cephalocon opening session to attend to [Sage Weil's keynote speech](https://youtu.be/szE4Hg1eXoA). After thanking the sponsors and the volunteers for their efforts, Sage talked about the success of Ceph over the years and mentioned the current efforts to make Ceph more user robust, scalable and user friendly.

### Cephalocon Results

According the report from the conference organization Cephalocon had 1024 attendees:

- 41% Infrastructure (DevOps, SysAdmins, etc)
- 25% Engineering (Developers, Architects, Engineers)
- 20% C-Level (CTO, CEO)
- 14% Other (Students, Media, etc)

All the keynotes and talks have been streamed and 20512 people watched the sessions [online](http://www.itdks.com/eventlist/detail/1971). We uploaded all the conference videos to Ceph YouTube Channel under the [Cephalocon APAC 2018 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrBUGiINAakNgeLvjald7NcWps_yDCblr), as well published the slides we received on [Ceph Community Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/Inktank_Ceph/tag/cephalocon-apac-2018).

### Benefits for the project

Besides promoting the project, Cephalocon brought several benefits to Ceph community.

Cephalocon helped us to understand better the Chinese community and it will allow the project to develop a better relationship with the contributors and improve the collaboration.

The discussions and brainstorm held during the conference provided new ideas and feedback from Ceph user community including CERN, IHEP and Deutsche Telekom which will help us to make the technology even better!

### The next Cephalocon

At the end of Cephalocon we started discussing ideas for the next edition, and we will start to plan it soon.
