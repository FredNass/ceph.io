Today the Apache Software Foundation [announced](http://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/the_apache_software_foundation_announces) that Apache CloudStack has graduated from the Apache Incubator and become a Top Level Project.

New Apache projects start in the Incubator, where they work to build a strong, multi-firm community and adopt the governance practices and philosophies common to all Apache projects. Anyone familiar with Apache knows that this is no small feat; while the end result is worth the struggle, adopting the Apache Way can be a long road.

We salute the Apache CloudStack project for this accomplishment, and we look forward to building amazing things together in the years to come. On behalf of the entire Ceph team, congratulations!
