The Ceph developer summit that we [announced](http://ceph.com/events/ceph-developer-summit/) a few weeks ago is nearly upon us! Since the event is next week we wanted to make sure that everyone was aware of the details for participation and attendence.

**Summit Date: 07 May @ 8a – 2p PDT (GMT -8)**

The community has already been hard at work generating blueprints for evaluation and discussion. The next step is to discuss those blueprints and figure out how it will all fit together for the “Dumpling” release. Read on for details on how we plan on running the summit, and how you can be prepared to participate.

### Blueprints

Even though this was our first time going through the blueprint process (and the process still is being defined as we go), we still managed to generate 16 blueprints! There is a great variety of features and changes the community would like to see, and a number of different stakeholders who are offering to contribute.

For the full list of blueprints, see the Blueprint page on the [wiki](http://wiki.ceph.com/01Planning/02Blueprints).

The next step is to decide which of these changes will make it in to the “Dumpling” release, and how it all fits together. This is where the summit comes in!

### Summit

Sage and team have spent some time reviewing the available blueprints and have come up with a **[discussion schedule for the Summit](http://wiki.ceph.com/01Planning/Developer_Summit)**. These discussions should accomplish the following:

- Identify a blueprint owner, if necessary
- Discuss the possible ways the blueprint might be implemented
- Identify the necessary work items and record them in the session's etherpad
- Determine whether the work can be completed before the Cuttlefish feature freeze
- Identify interested parties and discuss ownership of work items

If you submitted a blueprint that made it into the schedule, please be prepared to lead the discussion. If you can't make it to the summit, please [let us know](mailto:community@ceph.com). We'll be reaching out to individual blueprint owners to confirm.

### Tools

We chose to make this a small, online event so that more people could attend and contribute in a meaningful way without having to disrupt their lives with travel time and cost.  In order to facilitate these virtual discussions, we will be using a few tools.

**Google Hangouts** – The video conferencing setup we are using is a broadcasted Google Hangout. This means that up to 10 "speakers" can participate, while any number of community members may spectate from the public URL. The talks will also be captured automatically as YouTube videos and published to our channel for later consumption.  If you want to be one of the 10 "speakers" in the hangout, make sure to **add your name** to the Interested Parties blueprint field.

**Etherpad** – Each session will have an associated etherpad for collaborative note taking during the session. This should allow us to capture architectural decisions, issues, work items, and other notes during the sessions.

**IRC** – Each track will have its own logged IRC channel for discussion. This will allow asyncronous discussion, offsite-links, and questions to the "speakers" in a format that can be logged and posted for later consumption.

All of these tools will go live on the day of the summit so as not to have spam content or general indexing done before then.  To find them, click the links in the schedule grid.

### Conclusion

Everything is now set to go live next week for the summit. The tools should all go live on the day of the summit, so keep an eye on that summit page for the appropriate participation links and make sure you join the IRC channel a little before it gets started for last minute notes or changes. Thanks to everyone who has been working hard building blueprints and volunteering their time and energy to make Ceph the greatest storage platform available. See you next week!
