This release includes a few critical bug fixes for the radosgw, including a fix for hanging operations on large objects. There are also several bug fixes for radosgw multi-site replications, and a few backported features. Also, notably, the ‘osd perf’ command (which dumps recent performance information about active OSDs) has been backported.

We recommend that all 0.67.x Dumpling users upgrade.

Notable changes:

- ceph-fuse: fix crash in caching code
