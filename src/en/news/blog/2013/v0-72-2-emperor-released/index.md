This is the second bugfix release for the v0.72.x Emperor series. We have fixed a hang in radosgw, and fixed (again) a problem with monitor CLI compatiblity with mixed version monitors. (In the future this will no longer be a problem.)

Upgrading:

- The JSON schema for the ‘osd pool set …’ command changed slightly. Please avoid issuing this particular command via the CLI while there is a mix of v0.72.1 and v0.72.2 monitor daemons running.

Changes:

- mon: ‘osd pool set …’ syntax change
- osd: added test for missing on-disk HEAD object
- osd: fix osd bench block size argument
- rgw: fix hang on large object GET
- rgw: fix rare use-after-free
- rgw: various DR bug fixes
- rgw: do not return error on empty owner when setting ACL
- sysvinit, upstart: prevent starting daemons using both init systems
