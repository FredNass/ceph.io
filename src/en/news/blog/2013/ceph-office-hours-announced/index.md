If you watch the mailing lists closely you will already have seen the new “[Office Hours](http://www.mail-archive.com/ceph-devel@vger.kernel.org/msg13155.html)” announcement that went out yesterday. We are very excited about the opportunities this provides our larger community for getting directly involved. While Inktank may be the first, we’re hoping that many other organizations will help to “man the rails” in order to answer Ceph questions at times convenient to all parts of the world! Read on for Ross Turk’s unveiling of the program:

> Hi!
> 
> As the Ceph community grows, it’s important that help is available to new  
> users. Up to this point, Inktank engineers have been monitoring the channel  
> and mailing list as time permits. That made sense when there wasn’t much foot  
> traffic, but we have a lot now! We’d like to introduce something a bit more  
> predictable.
> 
> Inktank is establishing “office hours” for IRC and the ceph-users mailing list.  
> During these hours, an Inktank engineer will be focused on answering questions  
> and providing guidance to community users of Ceph. Our first office hours will  
> take place tomorrow \[14 MAR 2013\].
> 
> Inktank office hours are posted on the new Getting Help page:  
> [http://ceph.com/resources/getting-help](http://ceph.com/resources/getting-help)
> 
> Naturally, folks from Inktank will still be around outside of those hours,  
> although they may not be dedicated to the task of helping others. It’s  
> important to keep in mind that this isn’t tech support and it doesn’t come with  
> any of the guarantees you would expect from a professional support contract.
> 
> You may have noticed that the Getting Help page has our Inktank logo on it. I  
> would like to do the same for any organization or individual who is interested  
> in establishing office hours of their own. There are plenty of hours left –  
> drop a line to [community@ceph.com](mailto:community@ceph.com) if you’re interested!
