There have been several important fixes that we’ve backported to bobtail that users are hitting in the wild.  Most notably, there was a problem with pool names with – and \_ that OpenStack users were hitting, and memory usage by ceph-osd and other daemons due to the trimming of in-memory logs.  This and more is fixed in v0.56.4.  We recommend that all bobtail users upgrade.

Notable changes include:

- mon: fix bug in bringup with IPv6
- reduce default memory utilization by internal logging (all daemons)
- rgw: fix for bucket removal
- rgw: reopen logs after log rotation
- rgw: fix multipat upload listing
- rgw: don’t copy object when copied onto self
- osd: fix caps parsing for pools with – or \_
- osd: allow pg log trimming when degraded, scrubbing, recoverying (reducing memory consumption)
- osd: fix potential deadlock when ‘journal aio = true’
- osd: various fixes for collection creation/removal, rename, temp collections
- osd: various fixes for PG split
- osd: deep-scrub omap key/value data
- osd: fix rare bug in journal replay
- osd: misc fixes for snapshot tracking
- osd: fix leak in recovery reservations on pool deletion
- osd: fix bug in connection management
- osd: fix for op ordering when rebalancing
- ceph-fuse: report file system size with correct units
- mds: get and set directory layout policies via virtual xattrs
- mkcephfs, init-ceph: close potential security issues with predictable filenames

Upgrading:

- There is one minor change (fix) in the output to the ‘ceph osd tree –format=json’ command.
- The MDS disk format has changed from prior releases \*and\* from v0.57. In particular, upgrades to v0.56.4 are safe, but you cannot move from v0.56.4 to v0.57 if you are using the MDS for CephFS; you must upgrade directly to v0.58 (or later) instead.
