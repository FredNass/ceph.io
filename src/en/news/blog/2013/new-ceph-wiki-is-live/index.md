For those who have used the wiki in recent history you may have noticed that it had been sitting in a read-only state for a little bit around the holidays here. Today the wiki is [back in action](http://wiki.ceph.com) and better than ever! While we are still using MindTouch, we have moved to the SaaS version that allows us to offload the physical infrastructure and gain a few nice features as well.

### Logging In

While the new version is quite nice to look at there are a few things that I would like to point out. First, when you log in you may notice that it redirects you to wikilogin.ceph.com, this is normal. We are running our own custom OAuth plugin that will allow you to continue using your google credentials as before. The first time you log in it will ask you to choose a new user name. You can plug in your preferred user name, or a new one, it doesn’t matter. The previous content and edits have been archived and are not assigned to any existing users. You should only have to do this once. If you have problems please contact [community@inktank.com](mailto:community@inktank.com) or ping scuttlemonkey on IRC and I’ll make sure to get you squared away.

### Content and Functionality

With respect to the content and functionality there are a few things worth pointing out. if you take a look at some of the [guide content](http://inktank-prod.mindtouch.us/Guides/Getting_Started) there are a few different types (tabs) that you will see: “Guide Content,” “How-To,” and “Reference.” These are pre-defined page templates that will help to classify and aggregate content in the appropriate places for easy consumption. Every user should be able to create pages and utilize the template that they feel best suits the content. If you have questions let me know.

Some of the new content features we have been discussing are slowly being added and will continue to be tweaked. The basics for the [Chum Bucket](https://inktank-prod.mindtouch.us/Development/Chum_Bucket) have started, but the sorting and tagging have not yet been added. Look for these in a future update.

Ultimately there is a lot of content that could still be added and this is where we need help from the community! If you are interested in helping out feel free to dive right in or ask the [community team](mailto:community@inktank.com) where you can be of the greatest help.

### Getting Acquianted with MindTouch

While many projects choose MediaWiki, we have decided to go with MindTouch for a while to see if things like their advanced knowledge base, polished UI, and automated content management tools might be a bit nicer in the long run. We realize that this may be a bit of a learning curve for some people and as such are providing a few resources if you wish to explore this new tool:

**Documentation** – MindTouch documentation and support resources can be found at [https://help.mindtouch.us](https://help.mindtouch.us).

**Training Videos** – MindTouch training plans and Self-Training videos can be found at [https://help.mindtouch.us/Support/Training](https://help.mindtouch.us/Support/Training).

**Getting Started with MindTouch** – Use these FAQ’s to get started with MindTouch. They cover a wide variety of topics and MindTouch is always improving their material.

As always, if you have questions, concerns, or anything for the good of the cause, feel free to contact the [community team](mailto:community@inktank.com) or scuttlemonkey on IRC.
