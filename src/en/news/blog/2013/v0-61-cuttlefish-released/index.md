There are a few things to keep in mind when upgrading from Bobtail, specifically with the monitor daemons.  Please see the [upgrade guide](http://ceph.com/docs/master/install/upgrading-ceph/) and/or the [complete release notes](http://ceph.com/docs/master/release-notes/#v0-61-cuttlefish).  In short: upgrade all of your monitors (more or less) at once.

Cuttlefish is the first Ceph release on our new three-month stable release cycle.  We are very pleased to have pulled everything together on schedule (well, only a week later than planned).  The next stable release, which will be code-named Dumpling, is slated for three months from now (beginning of August).
