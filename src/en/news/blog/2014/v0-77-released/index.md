This is the final development release before the Firefly feature freeze. The main items in this release include some additional refactoring work in the OSD IO path (include some locking improvements), per-user quotas for the radosgw, a switch to civetweb from mongoose for the prototype radosgw standalone mode, and a prototype leveldb-based backend for the OSD. The C librados API also got support for atomic write operations (read side transactions will appear in v0.78).

### UPGRADING

- The ‘ceph -s’ or ‘ceph status’ command’s ‘num\_in\_osds’ field in the JSON and XML output has been changed from a string to an int.
- The recently added ‘ceph mds set allow\_new\_snaps’ command’s syntax has changed slightly; it is now ‘ceph mds set allow\_new\_snaps true’. The ‘unset’ command has been removed; instead, set the value to ‘false’.
- The syntax for allowing snapshots is now ‘mds set allow\_new\_snaps <true|false>’ instead of ‘mds <set,unset> allow\_new\_snaps’.
