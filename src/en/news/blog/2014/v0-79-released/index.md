This release is intended to serve as a release candidate for firefly, which will hopefully be v0.80. No changes are being made to the code base at this point except those that fix bugs. Please test this release if you intend to make use of the new erasure-coded pools or cache tiers in firefly.

This release fixes a range of bugs found in v0.78 and streamlines the user experience when creating erasure-coded pools. There is also a raft of fixes for the MDS (multi-mds, directory fragmentation, and large directories). The main notable new piece of functionality is a small change to allow radosgw to use an erasure-coded pool for object data.

### UPGRADING

- Erasure pools created with v0.78 will no longer function with v0.79. You will need to delete the old pool and create a new one.
- A bug was fixed in the authentication handshake with big-endian architectures that prevent authentication between big- and little-endian machines in the same cluster. If you have a cluster that consists entirely of big-endian machines, you will need to upgrade all daemons and clients and restart.
- The ‘ceph.file.layout’ and ‘ceph.dir.layout’ extended attributes are no longer included in the listxattr(2) results to prevent problems with ‘cp -a’ and similar tools.
- Monitor ‘auth’ read-only commands now expect the user to have ‘rx’ caps. This is the same behavior that was present in dumpling, but in emperor and more recent development releases the ‘r’ cap was sufficient. The affected commands are:
    
    ceph auth export
    ceph auth get
    ceph auth get-key
    ceph auth print-key
    ceph auth list
