This is the second-to-last development release before Giant that contains new functionality. The big items to land during this cycle are the messenger refactoring from Matt Benjmain that lays some groundwork for RDMA support, a performance improvement series from SanDisk that improves performance on SSDs, lots of improvements to our new standalone civetweb-based RGW frontend, and a new ‘osd blocked-by’ mon command that allows admins to easily identify which OSDs are blocking peering progress. The other big change is that the OSDs and Monitors now distinguish between “misplaced” and “degraded” objects: the latter means there are fewer copies than we’d like, while the former simply means the are not stored in the locations where we want them to be.

Also of note is a change to librbd that enables client-side caching by default. This is coupled with another option that makes the cache write-through until a “flush” operations is observed: this implies that the librbd user (usually a VM guest OS) supports barriers and flush and that it is safe for the cache to switch into writeback mode without compromising data safety or integrity. It has long been recommended practice that these options be enabled (e.g., in OpenStack environments) but until now it has not been the default.

We have frozen the tree for the looming Giant release, and the next development release will be a release candidate with a final batch of new functionality.

### UPGRADING

- The client-side caching for librbd is now enabled by default (rbd cache = true). A safety option (rbd cache writethrough until flush = true) is also enabled so that writeback caching is not used until the library observes a ‘flush’ command, indicating that the librbd users is passing that operation through from the guest VM. This avoids potential data loss when used with older versions of qemu that do not support flush.
    
    > leveldb\_write\_buffer\_size = 32\*1024\*1024 = 33554432 // 32MB leveldb\_cache\_size = 512\*1024\*1204 = 536870912 // 512MB leveldb\_block\_size = 64\*1024 = 65536 // 64KB leveldb\_compression = false leveldb\_log = “”
    
    OSDs will still maintain the following osd-specific defaults:
    
    > leveldb\_log = “”
    
- The ‘rados getxattr ...’ command used to add a gratuitous newline to the attr value; it now does not.
