This is a big release, with lots of infrastructure going in for firefly. The big items include a prototype standalone frontend for radosgw (which does not require apache or fastcgi), tracking for read activity on the osds (to inform tiering decisions), preliminary cache pool support (no snapshots yet), and lots of bug fixes and other work across the tree to get ready for the next batch of erasure coding patches.

For comparison, here are the diff stats for the last few versions:

### UPGRADING

- The ‘osd pool create ...’ syntax has changed for erasure pools.
- The default CRUSH rules and layouts are now using the latest and greatest tunables and defaults. Clusters using the old values will now present with a health WARN state. This can be disabled by adding ‘mon warn on legacy crush tunables = false’ to ceph.conf.
