This release fixes a few important bugs in the radosgw and fixes several packaging and environment issues, including OSD log rotation, systemd environments, and daemon restarts on upgrade.

We recommend that all v0.80.x Firefly users upgrade, particularly if they are using upstart, systemd, or radosgw.
