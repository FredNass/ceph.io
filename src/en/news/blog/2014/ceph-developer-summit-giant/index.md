The "Giant" Ceph Developer Summit looms....giantly... on the horizon and our wiki is ready for blueprint authors! We want your ideas, brainstorms, plans for work, or anything else you can dream up.

If you don't already have an account on the wiki please bear with us as we work through a few kinks of account creation that have cropped up with an upgraded plugin (it couldn't come at a worse time!). Creating an account will send you to wikilogin.ceph.com and ask for Google credentials. Once you enter them and select a username for the forum it may dump you to the old wiki at wikilogin.ceph.com instead of redirecting you back to wiki.ceph.com. If that happens please just head back to wiki.ceph.com by hand and it should let you in the door. \[edit: all auth components should be working now\]

If you have issues please send them to [Scuttlemonkey](mailto:patrick@inktank.com).

Now, on with the summit details!

[Submit Blueprint](https://wiki.ceph.com/Planning/Blueprints/Giant)

### Planned Work

As usual, Inktank has a body of work already planned. These features include expanded Ceph portability, an expanded plugin architecture, increased troubleshooting capability, and performance and stability work. In addition to feature work on existing modules, there is also planning underway to release the first CephFS tech preview in coordination with partners and the community. It should be an exciting release!

If you have an idea for implementation work in Giant, even if you are going to build it entirely on your own, please submit a blueprint so we know what to expect. Having a clear picture of the runway, especially as it relates to what testing requirements might be needed, is a huge help to our reviewers. If you are looking to get involved and would like inspiration, feel free to check out the [Ceph Tracker](http://tracker.ceph.com/), contact our [Community Team](mailto:community@inktank.com), or just stop by [IRC](http://ceph.com/resources/mailing-list-irc/) for a chat, we’d love to have you!

### The Summit

This summit will be run very similarly to other summits, in that it is both online and spread over two half days. We plan on continuing to use Google Hangouts as our video platform due to portability and ease of conversion to YouTube videos after the event has concluded. The connection info will be disseminated as the event gets closer, so watch for details.

As before, the underlying purpose of the summit will be to discuss how features should be implemented (rather than which features should be implemented). Once blueprint submission closes, Sage will review all available documents and decide which are the most relevant features that need to be discussed. Simple stand-alone projects probably don’t need a discussion, but please still create the blueprint.

If you have questions, comments, or anything for the good of the cause, feel free to hit up our community team. Looking forward to your blueprints and your bright, smiling faces at the Developer Summit.
