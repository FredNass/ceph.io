As many of you Ceph Day attendees are no doubt aware, we're fast approaching the release date for the 'Giant' release of Ceph. With that, it's time to get together at another virtual Ceph Developer Summit and chat about what development work is going in to the 'Hammer' release. Blueprint submissions are open now, so if you have any work you would like to contribute or request of our community developers, please submit it as soon as possible to ensure it gets a CDS slot.

The rough schedule of CDS and Hammer in general should look something like this:

| Date | Milestone |
| --- | --- |
| 30 SEP | Blueprint submissions begin |
| 17 OCT | Blueprint submissions end |
| 21 OCT | Summit agenda announced |
| 28 OCT | **Ceph Developer Summit: Day 1** |
| 29 OCT | **Ceph Developer Summit: Day 2** (if needed) |
| January 2015 | Hammer Release |

If there are enough sessions we are exploring the possibility of expanding our event into three days, but that will be predicated on the blueprint workload. As always, this event will be an online event (utilizing the BlueJeans system) so that everyone can attend from their own timezone.
