title: "v0.67.10 Dumpling released"
date: "2014-08-12"
author: "sage"

This stable update release for Dumpling includes primarily fixes for RGW, including several issues with bucket listings and a potential data corruption problem when multiple multi-part uploads race. There is also some throttling capability added in the OSD for scrub that can mitigate the performance impact on production clusters.

We recommend that all Dumpling users upgrade at their convenience.
