We know time is at a premium, and we also know there’s a thirst for Ceph knowledge. That’s why we’ve put together a series of 10-minute, on-demand webinars designed both to fit into hectic schedules and to deliver the targeted Ceph information you’re looking for.

Kyle Bader, Inktank’s very own Senior Solutions Architect, is at the helm of our series of five, last week walking through how to pick servers for the Ceph storage cluster. Click [here](http://www.inktank.com/webinars/?commid=105671) to learn–in just 10 minutes—things like how to compose an object storage device (OSD), set up a storage server data path, and select the right processors.

The rest of our five-part series will continue to unfold on each of the next four Thursdays. Look for 10-minute webinars on each of these topics in the coming weeks:

- How to configure your servers for the Ceph storage cluster – MARCH 27
- How to pick servers for the Ceph object gateway – APRIL 3
- How to configure your servers for the Ceph object gateway – APRIL 10
- How to configure OpenStack Cinder for Ceph RBD – APRIL 17
