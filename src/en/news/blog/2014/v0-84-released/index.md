The next Ceph development release is here! This release contains several meaty items, including some MDS improvements for journaling, the ability to remove the CephFS file system (and name it), several mon cleanups with tiered pools, several OSD performance branches, a new “read forward” RADOS caching mode, a prototype Kinetic OSD backend, and various radosgw improvements (especially with the new standalone civetweb frontend). And there are a zillion OSD bug fixes. Things are looking pretty good for the Giant release that is coming up in the next month.

### UPGRADING

- The [\*](http://ceph.com/docs/master/release-notes/#id1)\_kb perf counters on the monitor have been removed. These are replaced with a new set of [\*](http://ceph.com/docs/master/release-notes/#id3)\_bytes counters (e.g., cluster\_osd\_kb is replaced by cluster\_osd\_bytes).
- The rd\_kb and wr\_kb fields in the JSON dumps for pool stats (accessed via the ‘ceph df detail -f json-pretty’ and related commands) have been replaced with corresponding [\*](http://ceph.com/docs/master/release-notes/#id5)\_bytes fields. Similarly, the ‘total\_space’, ‘total\_used’, and ‘total\_avail’ fields are replaced with ‘total\_bytes’, ‘total\_used\_bytes’, and ‘total\_avail\_bytes’ fields.
- The ‘rados df –format=json’ output ‘read\_bytes’ and ‘write\_bytes’ fields were incorrectly reporting ops; this is now fixed.
- The ‘rados df –format=json’ output previously included ‘read\_kb’ and ‘write\_kb’ fields; these have been removed. Please use ‘read\_bytes’ and ‘write\_bytes’ instead (and divide by 1024 if appropriate).
