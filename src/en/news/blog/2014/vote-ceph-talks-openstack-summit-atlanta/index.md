There is only a little over a week left to vote for OpenStack Summit talks for the upcoming [Atlanta event](https://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-summit-atlanta-2014/).

[![2014-02-20_15-21-07](images/2014-02-20_15-21-07-240x220.png)](http://ceph.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-20_15-21-07.png)

While it can be hard to narrow down the list since there are so many great talks, we thought it might be helpful to create a short list of talks that touch on Ceph or something closely related. If any of these topics interest you please stop on by and give them a vote.

While you are there you can peruse some of the other great talks and perhaps find a few others to endorse. At the very least you should book your tickets now as the OpenStack events are always jam packed with useful information and great people.
