The Ceph Project is very pleased to be participating in the upcoming round of [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) and we are now looking for mentors to guide the project interns.

If you're not familiar with Outreachy, the program "provides three-month internships for people from groups traditionally underrepresented in tech", according to the Outreachy website. "Interns work remotely with mentors from Free and Open Source Software communities on projects ranging from programming, user experience, documentation, illustration and graphical design, to data science. Interns often find employment after their internship with Outreachy sponsors or in jobs that use the FOSS skills they learned during their internship."

There has been quite a bit of interest within the Ceph community already about mentorships, so we wanted to clarify scheduling for the submission of project ideas.

**Sept. 28, 2017** is the deadline for interested mentors to send [Leo Vaz](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Lvaz) and [Ali Maredia](http://tracker.ceph.com/users/2858) project ideas. Ali will use the mentors' submissions to post available projects on the website. Mentors should be prepared to offer initial tasks for prospective applicants during the application phase, so they can understand the project better and demonstrate that they have relevant skills. See Outreachy's [requirements and advice for mentors](https://www.outreachy.org/mentor/mentor-faq/) for more information. Submitted projects will be posted on Ceph.com by **Oct. 2**, at which time interested applicants will start getting in touch with mentors, work on initial tasks, and prepare their applications. **Oct. 23** is a key date for Outreachy: the applications deadline for the program. This can't be missed, as this is when Leo and Ali will begin working with mentors to identify interns to accept. By **Nov. 9**, accepted interns will be announced on the Outreachy site, and the actual internship period will occur betweenÂ  **Dec. 5, 2017** and **Mar. 5, 2018**.

Anyone who is interested in learning more about becoming an Outreachy mentor for Ceph should contact Leo or Ali.
