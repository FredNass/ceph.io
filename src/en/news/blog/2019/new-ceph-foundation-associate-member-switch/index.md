Eight months ago the Ceph Foundation was announced with 31 founding organization members to create an open, collaborative, and neutral home for project stakeholders to coordinate their development and community investments in the Ceph ecosystem.Â  Since then, three more members have joined, two as General members and one as an Associate member.  

Today we're excited to announce our newest associate member of the Foundation, SWITCH.
