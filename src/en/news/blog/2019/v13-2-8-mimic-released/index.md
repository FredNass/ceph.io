This is the eighth release in the Ceph Mimic stable release series. Its sole purpose is to fix a regression that found its way into the previous release.

## Notable Changes

- Due to a missed backport, clusters in the process of being upgraded from 13.2.6 to 13.2.7 might suffer an OSD crash in build\_incremental\_map\_msg. This regression was reported in [https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/43106](https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/43106) and is fixed in 13.2.8 (this release). Users of 13.2.6 can upgrade to 13.2.8 directly - i.e., skip 13.2.7 - to avoid this.
